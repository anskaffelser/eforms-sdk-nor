    These BTs scope the legislation governing the procurement.
    Either an EU legal reference (BT-01-notice) or a national
    legal basis pair (BT-01(e) and BT-01(f)) must be provided,
    but not both.
  members:
    - BT-01-notice
    - BT-01(e)-procedure
    - BT-01(f)-procedure
  exclusivity:
    mode: select-one
    combinations:
      - [bt-01-notice]
      - [bt-01(e)-procedure, bt-01(f)-procedure]
  notes:
    - BT-01-notice as a valid code apart from 'other' suffices
    - BT-01-notice = 'other' means BT-01(e)-procedure and
      BT-01(f)-procedure must be populated with valid preselect codes
      from our codelist.
